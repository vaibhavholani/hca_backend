# HCA Backend Project Log

## Audit Trail and User Management Implementation

**Date:** March 8, 2025

### End Goal
Implement a comprehensive audit trail and user management system for the HCA backend application to track all changes to the database and provide role-based access control.

### Completed Steps

1. **Database Schema Changes**
   - Created new tables: `users`, `permissions`, and `audit_log`
   - Added audit fields to all existing tables: `created_at`, `created_by`, `last_updated`, `last_updated_by`
   - Created SQL script for schema changes: `API_Database/audit_trail_schema.sql`
   - Created setup script: `API_Database/setup_audit_trail.py`

2. **User Management Implementation**
   - Created User model in `Individual/User.py` extending the Individual base class
   - Implemented password hashing using bcrypt
   - Added authentication methods and permission checking
   - Updated authentication system in `app.py` to use database authentication
   - Added JWT token with user role and permissions
   - Added token refresh functionality
   - Created user management API endpoints in `app.py`

3. **Audit Trail Implementation**
   - Updated database connector in `psql/db_connector.py` to include audit trail functionality
   - Added `current_user_id` parameter to `execute_query` function
   - Implemented audit log recording for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
   - Created audit log functions in `API_Database/audit_log.py`
   - Added methods to retrieve audit history

4. **Entity Class Modifications**
   - Updated base entity classes `Entities/Entry.py` and `Individual/Individual.py`
   - Added audit trail fields
   - Updated CRUD methods to include current user information
   - Implemented methods to retrieve audit history

5. **API Endpoint Updates**
   - Added authentication to endpoints
   - Added permission checking with custom decorator
   - Added audit trail endpoints for retrieving and searching audit logs

6. **Dependency Updates**
   - Added bcrypt to requirements.txt

### Current Progress
The audit trail and user management system has been fully implemented. The system now tracks all changes to the database, including who made the changes and when. It also provides role-based access control to restrict access to certain resources and operations.

### Files Modified
- `API_Database/audit_trail_schema.sql` (new)
- `API_Database/setup_audit_trail.py` (new)
- `API_Database/audit_log.py` (new)
- `Individual/User.py` (new)
- `psql/db_connector.py`
- `Entities/Entry.py`
- `Individual/Individual.py`
- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`

### Backend Information
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **User Roles**: 'admin' and 'user' with different permissions
- **Audit Trail**: All database changes are logged with user information, timestamp, and details of the changes
- **API Endpoints**: New endpoints for user management and audit trail retrieval

### Next Steps
1. Test the implementation thoroughly
2. Update frontend to use the new authentication system
3. Create user interface for viewing audit logs
4. Implement password reset functionality
