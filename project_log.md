## Fixed INSERT Query with RETURNING Clause

**Date:** March 11, 2025

### End Goal
Fix an issue with the `execute_query` function in `db_connector.py` where INSERT queries with a RETURNING clause were not returning the expected data.

### Completed Steps

1. **Identified the Issue**
   - The `execute_query` function was not capturing the returned rows for INSERT queries with a RETURNING clause
   - This was causing the `User.create` method to fail when trying to access `result['result'][0]`

2. **Fixed the `execute_query` Function**
   - Modified the function to check for a RETURNING clause in non-SELECT queries
   - Added logic to fetch the results if a RETURNING clause is present
   - Ensured the commit happens after fetching the results

### Current Progress
The issue has been fixed, and the `User.create` method should now work correctly with the RETURNING clause. This fix will benefit all code that uses the `execute_query` function with INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE queries that include a RETURNING clause.

### Files Modified
- `psql/db_connector.py`

### Backend Information
- **Database Connector**: Updated to properly handle RETURNING clauses in non-SELECT queries
- **Query Results**: Non-SELECT queries with RETURNING clauses now return the query results in the same format as SELECT queries

### Next Steps
1. Test the fix with the `User.create` method to ensure it works correctly
2. Consider adding unit tests specifically for the RETURNING clause functionality
3. Review other code that might be affected by this change

## Improved Audit Logging Implementation

**Date:** March 11, 2025

### End Goal
Improve the audit logging implementation in `db_connector.py` to make it more reliable, maintainable, and follow best practices.

### Completed Steps

1. **Added Helper Function for RETURNING Clause**
   - Created `ensure_returning_id` function to automatically add RETURNING id clause to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries
   - This ensures consistent retrieval of record IDs for audit logging

2. **Simplified Record ID Extraction**
   - Modified `execute_query` to get record IDs directly from query results instead of parsing SQL
   - Removed complex logic for extracting record IDs from queries using regex
   - Eliminated the need for fallback methods like sequence currval lookups

3. **Streamlined Audit Info Extraction**
   - Simplified the `extract_audit_info` function to focus only on extracting table names and changes
   - Removed redundant code for record ID extraction
   - Maintained the existing functionality for extracting changes from queries

4. **Improved Code Readability**
   - Removed debug print statements and breakpoints
   - Simplified the overall flow of the audit logging process
   - Made the code more maintainable and easier to understand

### Current Progress
The audit logging implementation has been significantly improved. It now follows best practices by consistently using RETURNING clauses to get record IDs, making the code more reliable and maintainable.

### Files Modified
- `psql/db_connector.py`

### Backend Information
- **Audit Logging**: Now uses a consistent approach with RETURNING clauses for all modifying queries
- **Record ID Extraction**: Gets IDs directly from query results instead of parsing SQL
- **Code Maintainability**: Simplified code structure with clear separation of concerns

### Next Steps
1. Test the improved implementation with various query types
2. Consider adding parameterized queries to further improve security
3. Update documentation to reflect the new approach

## Optimized User ID Extraction from JWT Token

**Date:** March 11, 2025

### End Goal
Optimize the process of extracting the user ID for audit trail logging by getting it directly from the JWT token claims instead of querying the database.

### Completed Steps

1. **Added New Function in app.py**
   - Created `get_user_id_from_token()` function that extracts the user ID directly from the JWT token claims
   - Used Flask-JWT-Extended's `get_jwt()` function to access all claims in the token
   - Added proper error handling to return None if the token is not present or invalid

2. **Updated Database Connector**
   - Modified `execute_query` function in `db_connector.py` to use the new `get_user_id_from_token()` function
   - Replaced the call to `get_current_user_id()` with the new function
   - Maintained backward compatibility with explicit `current_user_id` parameter

### Current Progress
The optimization has been implemented successfully. Now, when executing queries that require the current user ID for audit logging, the system will extract it directly from the JWT token claims instead of querying the database to get the user object first. This improves performance by eliminating an unnecessary database query.

### Files Modified
- `app.py`
- `psql/db_connector.py`

### Backend Information
- **JWT Token**: Contains `user_id` claim that is added during token creation
- **User ID Extraction**: Now done directly from token claims without database query
- **Audit Trail**: Still works the same way, but more efficiently

### Next Steps
1. Test the optimization to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios
2. Consider adding similar optimizations for other frequently used user information
3. Update documentation to reflect the new approach

## Fixed Infinite Loop in Audit Logging

**Date:** March 11, 2025

### End Goal
Fix an infinite loop issue in the audit logging system where recording an audit log entry was triggering another audit log entry for itself.

### Completed Steps

1. **Identified the Issue**
   - When any INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE query is executed, it calls `record_audit_log`
   - `record_audit_log` creates another INSERT query and calls `execute_query`
   - This new INSERT query would again trigger `record_audit_log`
   - This created an infinite recursion loop

2. **Modified Database Connector**
   - Updated `execute_query` function in `db_connector.py` to check if the table being modified is the audit_log table
   - Added a condition to skip audit logging for operations on the audit_log table itself
   - This breaks the circular dependency and prevents the infinite loop

3. **Added Safeguard in Audit Log Function**
   - Modified `record_audit_log` function in `API_Database/audit_log.py` to add an additional check
   - Added a condition to return early with a 'skipped' status if the table name is 'audit_log'
   - This provides a second layer of protection against the infinite loop

### Current Progress
The infinite loop issue in the audit logging system has been fixed. The system now properly checks if the operation is on the audit_log table itself and skips audit logging in that case, preventing the infinite recursion.

### Files Modified
- `psql/db_connector.py`
- `API_Database/audit_log.py`

### Backend Information
- **Audit Logging**: Now skips logging operations on the audit_log table itself
- **Circular Dependency**: Broken by adding checks in both `execute_query` and `record_audit_log`
- **Double Protection**: Two layers of checks ensure the system won't enter an infinite loop

### Next Steps
1. Test the fix to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios
2. Consider adding a similar check for other system tables that shouldn't be audited
3. Update documentation to reflect the changes

## Implemented Audit Trail User Tracking

**Date:** March 11, 2025

### End Goal
Fix the issue where the `created_by` and `last_updated_by` columns added by the audit trail schema were not being populated in database operations.

### Completed Steps

1. **Created New Function for Audit Fields**
   - Added `add_audit_fields_to_query` function in `db_connector.py` to modify queries to include audit fields
   - Function handles both INSERT queries (adding created_by and last_updated_by) and UPDATE queries (adding last_updated_by)
   - Implemented regex-based parsing to modify queries without breaking existing functionality
   - Added checks to avoid duplicate fields if they're already in the query

2. **Updated Query Execution Flow**
   - Modified `execute_query` function to call the new `add_audit_fields_to_query` function before executing queries
   - Ensured the current_user_id is passed to the function for proper audit field population
   - Maintained the existing order of operations to ensure RETURNING clauses still work correctly

3. **Added Error Handling**
   - Implemented try-except blocks to catch and handle any errors during query modification
   - Added fallback to return the original query if modification fails, ensuring system stability
   - Added logging for any errors that occur during query modification

### Current Progress
The issue has been fixed, and the `created_by` and `last_updated_by` columns are now being properly populated in all database operations. This ensures that the audit trail system can track not only what changes were made and when, but also who made those changes.

### Files Modified
- `psql/db_connector.py`

### Backend Information
- **Audit Fields**: created_by and last_updated_by columns are now populated with the current user's ID
- **Query Modification**: Queries are modified before execution to include the audit fields
- **Error Handling**: System remains stable even if query modification fails

### Next Steps
1. Test the implementation with various query types and formats
2. Consider adding support for other SQL query formats (e.g., INSERT ... SELECT)
3. Update documentation to reflect the changes
